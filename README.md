# NLP-ASSIGNMENT-
This repository contains my solutions for three natural language processing (NLP) assignments covering character-level analysis, text classification, and text generation.

Assignment 1: Character-Level NLP

This assignment focuses on fundamental character-level text processing. The tasks include:
Tokenization: Breaking down a paragraph into individual characters.
Frequency Analysis: Counting the frequency of each character using collections.Counter.
Data Cleaning: Removing punctuation and digits to keep only alphabetical characters.
Visualization: Plotting a bar chart of the top 10 most frequent characters using matplotlib.


Assignment 2: News Classification using TF-IDF and SVM

This project builds a full machine learning workflow for classifying news articles. The main stages include:
Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw news text data.
Vectorization: Transforming the text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency).
Model Training: Applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to learn patterns from the vectorized data.
Evaluation: Measuring performance through accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.


Assignment 3: Text Generation using Markov Chains

This task demonstrates a basic probabilistic method for generating text with the help of a Markov chain. The key activities include:
Model Construction: Building a bigram-based language model from a given text file.
Sentence Generation: Producing five new, randomly generated sentences using the trained model.
Distribution Analysis: Comparing the sentence length distribution of the generated text with that of the original source to evaluate how closely the model replicates the original structure.
